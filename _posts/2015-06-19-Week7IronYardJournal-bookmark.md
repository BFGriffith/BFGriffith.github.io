### Git Flow like a laser-light-show...

* (`git log --graph --abbrev-commit --decorate --date=relative --all`)
* This week we learned about some of the convenient and rigorously version-controlled workflows available using `GitFlow` — check out this cheatsheet at the link below for a very nicely accessible and visual summary of its main capabilities:
* [GitFlow—cheatsheet](http://danielkummer.github.io/git-flow-cheatsheet/)
* **tl;dr** — using this workflow on a project streamlines and automates a few `git` processes' critical steps and reduces potential for human errors in some areas, especially when it comes to a large project releasing several versions and having multiple feature branches being developed simultaneously, especially by different people.
