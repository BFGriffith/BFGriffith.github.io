# A little simple stying goes a long way...
* In addition to a pleasing layout replete with golden-ratios, neatly gridded columns, fancy carosels, or similar design features â€” even relatively simple styles can have a positive impact on user-experience. Indeed, when it comes to buttons, or images that are clickable as functional links (or are otherwise part of the UI), a few basic styles can really make the elements on a page much more dynamic and responsive. For example, consider adding pseudoelements using `::before` or `::after`
* also, playing around with `box-shadow:`, `transition: all .2s ease-in-out;`, or `transform: scale(X);` can really create some great effects very simply
  * `dashed` outlines or borders can also be used to great effect when combined with some of these other techniques
* However, for more advanced funtionality and user-experience, one can wire up some jQuery with CSS animations tied to click events or other interactions.
