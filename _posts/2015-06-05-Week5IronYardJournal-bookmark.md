### A Largely Comprehensive Template for Consistent Design:

This week I'm going to share an awesome web-design tool created by Brad Frost([@brad_frost](https://twitter.com/brad_frost)) and Dave Olsen([@dmolsen](https://twitter.com/dmolsen)).
* Here is [a basic description of what it is and what it isn't...](http://patternlab.io/)
* And here is the actual resource: [Brad Frost's "Pattern Lab"](http://demo.patternlab.io/)
* If you're looking to keep track of consistent styles and designs across a large project, then I can't imagine what a better tool for that task would look like; the "Pattern Lab" really is a superbly clever and thoroughgoing format.
