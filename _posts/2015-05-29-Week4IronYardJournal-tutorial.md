### **DOC-block commentary**, basic tutorial:

This is an important piece of syntax and planning-structure that I learned this week. It works well in Atom or most other text-editors, is intuitive and easy to type (using a comment and Markdown sort of syntax), and can be used by [**jsdoc**](http://usejsdoc.org/) to create some very nice documentation... (an index of **@**-terms this format will accept are at the previous link, and a simple example is below...)

```
/**
    * @param {Array} someFunction <explain what this function means, enumerate arguments...>
    * @return { ... }
*/
```

Installation instructions are [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsdoc). More information is [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSDoc).

Personally, as a newbie to JavaScript, I found learning this format not only a best practice that I should get in the habit of doing when appropriate on the job (with particularly complex of important functions, at least), but also quite helpful for planning implementation of User-Stories into functions.
