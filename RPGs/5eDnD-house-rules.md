    >The following are various “house rule” options that B.F. Griffith has either already successfully implemented in past games and knows from experience that many players will tend to have fun with (or at least find unobjectionable), or which he is seriously contemplating playtesting in at least some future campaign settings with appropriately complementary thematic subgenres／tones: assuming, of course, that enough players who share his tastes are also willing to experiment with them!<br><br>Any mechanics not specified or amended in these house rules can obviously be assumed to default to 5eD&D officially published “rules as written”＋errata and any relevant “Sage Advice” or Jeremy Crawford Tweeted “rules as intended” clarifications…<br>In summary, most of these optional house rules are not intended to catastrophically unbalance or stray too drastically far away from RAW＋RAI default 5eD&D mechanics that most experienced players will most likely already be familiar with.<br><br>Ultimately, the more complicated prospective “house rules” tacked onto any already far from “rules light” ttRPG such as D&D are, the less likely those rules arguably are to be much fun or convenient to practically implement. Consequently, these are all meant to be relatively simple and straightforward prospective adjustments which don’t stray far from the core mechanics they are based on… Please feel free to use these rules in your own games in any way you wish (so long as you don’t plagiarize any of their unique wording or ideas in any profit seeking publication without permission); additionally, B.F. Griffith welcomes any constructive suggestions for how these rules might be improved or feedback regarding any problematic interactions they might have with existing rules that might warrant reconsideration!

        <h2 
          class="accordion_header" 
          title="quod nocet, sæpe doce">EXPANDED MIN-MAX OPTIONS 📊</h2>
        <p class="accordion_body">B.F. Griffith personally prefers the “point-buy” system detailed on the 2014 Player’s Handbook page 13 (rather than rolling) for Ability-Score generation <small>(before applying traditional racial-modifiers or otherwise customizing your Ability-Score increases or creating a “Custom Lineage” per Tasha’s Cauldron of Everything pages 7→8)</small>, mostly for reasons of both fairness and balance／consistency according to the central 5eD&D philosophy of “bounded-accuracy” as well as empowering players who enjoy optimization more predictable control over their character build…<br><br>However, the usual point-buy options could easily be expanded to allow selections beyond Ability Scores of 15 (such as the following arrays which go beyond the “standard array” options and point-buy system presented in the PHB), by spending (out of 27 starting points for ability-score buying):</p>
        <ul class="accordion_body">
          <li>12 points for an ability-score of 16</li>
          <li>15 points for an ability-score of 17</li>
          <li>19 points for an ability-score of 18</li>
          <li>24 points for an ability-score of 19</li>
          <li>or (though I don’t know why this would ever be a better option than aligning a favored score with racial-modifiers) all 27 points for an ability-score of 20 (leaving the rest at 8)</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="accordion_body">This house-rule is designed to be fully consistent with point-buy of Ability Scores using the standard 27 starting points being accomplished before applying racial-modifiers, as usual, and assuming no scores lower than 8 allowed unless players really want to min-max with some semi-disabled characters in some aspects, in which case a DM amenable to this might consider the following extension table below, which could grant players more than 27 starting points IF they choose to take some Ability Scores even lower than 8 as a trade-off.<br>An additional advantage of point-buy is that, without any need for secure digital rolling, it allows players to more easily discuss and plan their characters in advance of session-zero／one rather than having to entirely “roll-up” characters “on the spot” at the table (ideally, this should allow more valuable uses of time in-person／session-zero for planning party bonds, more detailed backstories, tweaking party “balance” or particular areas of PC expertise to spotlight, discussing“hard” or “soft” limits regarding content featured in detail or only included to a more limited or “veiled” (i.e. “off camera” rather than described or dwelled on in detail) degree throughout the campaign, preferred house-rules, thematic subgenre specifics or content-focus expectations, preferred “pillars of play” to emphasize most, tone or setting milieu, etc.). It’s just simpler as well as much more balanced, and anyone who doesn’t want to bother with it can easily take the standard-array.</p>
        <ul class="accordion_body">
          <li>Anyway, here are some even more extreme alternatives for “min-max” Ability Scores if the DM is willing to allow some essentially “disabled” and heavily-penalized abilities (below 8) as a tradeoff to add some extra points beyond 27 to point-buy:</li>
        </ul>

The sword cries out, yet breaks not in the least, Back from the blow into the air it leaps.”">“With Durendal I’ll lay on thick and stout,<br>In blood the blade, to its golden hilt, I’ll drown.”🩸🗡</h2>
        <p class="accordion_body">A Critical-Hit scores double the damage-dice, plus any usual modifiers applied once, as per usual 5eRAW, but one of the additional damage-dice rolled is automatically treated as the maximum result of that die-type; however, this also applies to enemies and monsters when they score a critical-hit on PCs, of course! For example, if you critical-hit with a weapon or ranged-attack spell that normally does 2d6 points of damage, a critical-hit under this house-rule would do: 3d6＋6＋any-usual-mods points of damage (whereas a critical-hit with a 1d8 damage weapon would do 8＋1d8＋any-usual-mods damage).<br><br>This way, critical-hits almost always satisfyingly result in greater than normal max-roll damage instead of rolling snake-eyes🎲🎲 (though, of course, the danger is that enemies also gain this benefit to their critical-hits — so it makes critical-hits guaranteed to be more eventful, whether dishing out or receiving, but still less extreme and less “swingy” than either maximizing or doubling the entirety of the damage would be). ⚖️<br><br>Alternatively, while it is even less “swingy” and even more reliably deadly, many tables seeking higher than average critical-hits may prefer the simplicity of simply rolling as with a normal hit but then adding the maximum dice result of a normal hit along with any usual modifiers. For example, if you critical-hit with a weapon or ranged-attack spell that normally does 2d6 points of damage, a critical-hit under this simplified version of the house-rule would do: 12＋2d6＋any-usual-mods points of damage. 🩸</p>

          <li>revised <span style="font-weight:bold;">death-saving-throws:</span> death-saving-throw successes <span style="text-decoration:underline;">do</span> reset when a character regains consciousness, but death-saving-throw failures do <span style="text-decoration:underline;">not</span> reset when a character regains consciousness; however, after each successfully completed short-rest, one failed death-save is removed — or, after a successfully completed long-rest, all failed-death-saves are reset; additionally, most DMs using this rule may decide to somewhat “balance it out” by allowing that one casting of Lesser-Restoration can optionally be used to remove one accumulated death-save — or one casting of Greater-Restoration can optionally be used to remove all accumulated failed-death-saves</li>
          <li>PCs can creatively use the <span style="font-weight:bold;">“Help” action</span> to make a check that, if successful, will grant a dying player advantage on a death-saving-throw (using Medicine-check or something more creative: e.g. Strength to apply firm pressure on and bind the wound, Dexterity to remove fragments or insert a staunching item or rig a brace, an Arcana-check to call out to a player’s spirit, a Persuasion or Religion check screaming into the void dramatically for the ally to hold fast to life or praying for divine intercession, etc.); however, the DM should set an appropriate (and often quite high) DC for such checks based on the difficulty or exigency of the circumstances in order to keep death-saving-throws suitably dramtic and harrowing.</li>
          <li><span style="font-weight:bold;">Heroic-Recovery:</span> a character that successfully saves on all three death-saving-throws immediately comes back ready to fight at one-hit-point (for more epic moments); death-saving-throws occur at the beginning of a character's turn (so characters don’t ever achieve a third success on their turn but do nothing; however, this also applies to important enemies and NPCs)</li>
          <li>In summary: this house-rule provides a Pathfinder style “wounded” condition (to provide an ultimate fix for “whack-a-mole” dynamics in any party with healing-potions or magical-healing capabilities): if a character is healed from unconsciousness or all three successful death-saves are achieved such that a character returns to consciousness (including magically), the character gains the “Wounded 1” condition (starts with one failed-death-saving-throw if knocked unconscious again) — then, if dropped unconscious again but healed or returned to consciousness, the character gains the “Wounded 2” condition (two failed-death-saving-throws) — then, if healed or makes all three successful-saves again with no failures, the character gains the “Wounded 3” condition (a “pending” three failed death-saving-throws) such that the character would immediately die if dropped unconscious again! (see above for removing failed death-saving-throws accumulated due to “Wounded” condition by resting or perhaps by Restorative magic)</li>
          <li><span style="font-weight:bold;">OPTIONAL</span> increased <span style="font-weight:bold;">“coup de grâce” lethality:</span> if a character gets hit by anything while unconscious, 1→25damage = add one automatic death-save failure, 26→50damage = add two automatic death-save failures, 50+damage = three death-save failures and instant death</li>
          <li><span style="font-weight:bold;">OPTIONALLY:</span> conduct death-saving-throws as somewhat “secret” rolls seen only by the DM and the unconscious/dying PC, so the whole party does NOT know how many successes or failures have been achieved? (in order to greatly increase drama regarding whether to stabilize or heal a potentially dying PC or fight on to vanquish a deadly enemy with less metagaming)</li>

          title="morituri te salutant">MORE “REASONABLE”＆BALANCED NATURAL-HEALING MECHANICS:</h2>
        <p class="accordion_body" style="color:#e40712;">(tougher and at least slightly more “realistic” healing rules than 5eRAW default, but arguably still plenty “heroic” for fast-paced adventures — especially in settings retaining ample 5eRAW magical-healing options／features and not deviating too far from RAW “bounded-accuracy” mechanics, in general)</p>
        <ul class="accordion_body">
          <li>Whenever you’re forced unconscious, you also gain one point of exhaustion, in addition to the normal effects. However, the first level of exhaustion is revised／softened to only subtract 10 from Speed, while disadvantage on Ability-Checks is moved to the second level of exhaustion along with halved-Speed.</li>
          <li>During a Long-Rest <small>(amending Player’s Handbook page 186)</small>, rather than automatically regaining all hit-points up to maximum, a character’s remaining hit-dice (if any) can be “spent” (rolled＋Constitution-modifier for each) as usual to regain hit-points after at least one-hour spent resting rather than engaged in “light activity” on watch <small>(similarly to DMG page 267 “Slow Natural Healing” rules option)</small>, which is essentially like taking a short-rest within the first hour of an attempt at a long-rest, and then ½ total hit-dice are regained at the end of any successfully completed long-rest not interrupted by any “strenuous” adventuring activity or combat (per the usual rules).
            <ul><li>Furthermore, these just regained ½ of total hit-dice can also optionally be spent immediately to regain hit-points after a successful long-rest during which no more than one-hour out of the eight hour total was spent by that character at “light activity” such as keeping watch, or these hit-dice can be spent after an immediately subsequent short-rest if time allows (i.e. nine hours total rest including up to two hours of light-activity or time “on watch” as with a typical long-rest immediately followed by a short-rest). As usual, a character can only benefit mechanically from one long-rest per 24 hour period — so spending hit-dice immediately after a successful long-rest that could be more urgently needed later in the impending adventuring day before another long-rest can be completed is a calculated risk! In most settings, the DM anticipates this house-rule could be somewhat balanced by the possibility in many cases of attempting to flee or tactically-retreat by vehicle, mounts, or other magical means to temporarily escape danger if necessary (though this isn’t always an option in particularly perilous settings or relentless dire stakes battles that need to be won at any cost), as well as by encouraging increased “fast-forwarded” and summarized “downtime” compared to an overland campaign under constant threat in a “megadungeon” or dangerous wilderness, though there is no doubt this will sometimes require PCs to be more strategic compared to a traditional “heroic” high-fantasy campaign with routine “miraculously complete” recovery after each night’s long-rest. This house-rule is also intended as a counterbalance to the “single encounter day” dynamics common in many homebrew or sandbox campaigns wherein short-rests are often significantly more infrequent than 5eD&D guidelines anticipate and expect for ideal PC “resource-depletion” mechanics via multiple combat encounters per adventuring day.</li></ul>
          </li>
          <li>To compensate somewhat for the increased “grittiness” of these stricter healing and recovery mechanics, a sensible complementary house-rule could be to roll the hit-die for the increase to maximum hit-points upon each level-up, but let any roll below the average number [i.e. the “(or ?)” listed next to the hit-die type designated in each class description] default to that average number as a “floor” (plus Constitution-modifier as usual).</li>
          <li><span style="color:green;font-weight:bold;">Healer feat </span><small>(PHB page 167)</small>: When you use a healer’s kit to stabilize a dying creature as an action, that creature also regains 1 hit-point and typically regains consciousness. During a short-rest (not as an action), you can spend one use of a healer’s kit per hour to tend extensively to one creature and restore 1d6＋4 hit-points to it plus additional hit-points equal to your proficiency-bonus. The creature cannot regain hit-points from this feat again until it finishes a long-rest (and you do not gain the benefits of a short-rest if working on healing someone during it, however, using the kit in this way during a long-rest can be done as part of time “on watch” and still allow the healer to gain the benefits of the long-rest as long as no more than two creatures are healed in this way, in place of the normal two hours of “light activity” or “on-watch” time allowed during any successful long-rest).</li>

        <p class="accordion_body" style="color:#e40712;">(an attempt at significantly tougher and relatively much more “realistic” healing rules and “lingering” injuries than 5eRAW default, mostly inspired by Starfinder as well as older “classic” editions of D&D mechanics and the “Old School Renaissance” movement revamping and reorganizing them — but still remaining adequately “heroic” and arguably “playable” within otherwise mostly traditional 5eD&D mechanics, especially in settings retaining ample 5eD&D RAW magical-healing options／features available to PCs; however, these rules certainly may increase impetus for PCs to more frequently seek extended “downtime” recovery interludes and tactical-retreats, or else they will significantly increase the lethality risks of multiple prolonged combats over time using these rules whenever extended respite is not possible)</p>
        <ul class="accordion_body">
          <li>Whenever you’re forced unconscious, you also gain one point of exhaustion, in addition to the normal effects. However, the first level of exhaustion is revised/softened to only subtract 10 from Speed, while disadvantage on ability-checks is moved to the second level of exhaustion along with halved-Speed.</li>
          <li>Instead of simply a pool of hit-points as per 5eD&D RAW, player-characters (and some important monsters or NPCs who may follow similar mechanics at the DM’s discretion) have both “hit-points” and “Stamina-points” which increase at each level, with a separate and distinct maximum-total for each maintained as the character gains levels.</li>
          <li>Somewhat similarly to 2e-Advanced-D&D mechanics: assuming adequate food+water, characters normally heal naturally at a rate of only one-hit-point per “day” of “low activity” up to their hit-point-maximum total at current character-level — with “low” activity traditionally defined as nothing more strenuous throughout the day than “light”/downtime activities as during “rests” when not sleeping (per 5eD&D RAW), including keeping watch, or perhaps even riding a mount/vehicle at an unhurried/normal pace from one place to another in a not too harsh environment such as a flat roadway or wide and clear comfortable game trail. However, activities at any point throughout the day like fighting, running/galloping or forced-marches, lifting a heavy-boulder, subsisting through and enduring unsheltered treks through harsh environments full of difficult-terrain, or any other “strenuous” physical activity should prevent naturally healing any hit-points that day since such hardships would strain old or still tender wounds and might even reopen or otherwise aggravate them. A “low activity” day begins after successful completion of a long-rest (at least eight-hours) subsequent to losing hit-points (regardless of whether that long-rest was too soon after the previous one to benefit mechanically from more than one long-rest per 24-hour period) and that low-activity “day” ends after successful completion of the next long-rest (at least eight-hours and ending more than 24 hours after the beginning of the previous long-rest that started the “low activity” day).
            <ul>
              <li>If a character can manage complete “bedrest” (i.e. doing nothing but extremely “light” and nearly effortless activities such as “lounging” [in a relatively smooth-riding vehicle or well-equipped camp with bedroll and blanket/shade/shelter if necessary to provide a comfortable enough climate — or else an even more restful and sheltered environment such as an inn or similar lodgings with a friendly faction], conversing, reading, adequate eating/drinking, napping, moving very little, etc.) for an entire day (between two long-rests more than 24-hours apart as above) — then that character can regain three-hit-points per day of uninterrupted bedrest. Additionally, for each complete week of uninterrupted “bedrest” as defined above, the character can add any positive Constitution-modifier to the base of 21 hit-points of natural healing (three hit-points per day) regained during the entirety of that week.</li>
              <li><span style="font-style:bold;">OPTIONALLY:</span> To compensate somewhat for this greatly increased grittiness in healing and recovery mechanics, a sensible house-rule could be to roll the hit-die for each increase to maximum Stamina-points upon each level-up, but let any roll below the average number “(or ?)” next to the hit-die in the class description default to that average number as a “floor” of the minimum numbers of Stamina-points gained.</li>
              <li>When using these house-rules, any effects or features in 5eD&D RAW mechanics that add or grant “temporary-hit-points” should instead add or grant “temporary-Stamina-points” which do not permanently add to the maximum Stamina-point total, and are lost before normal Stamina-points whenever a character takes damage.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <ul class="accordion_body">
          <li style="font-style:bold;">Hit-points could then be the initial level starting-HP only, with all subsequent levels' hit-dice to stamina plus optionally including a 1st level hit-dice to starting stamina, and then the DM would need to decide whether to add Constitution-mod (or minimum one) hit-points per level, or to add that to stamina, or to both; or to add Constitution-mod to stamina each level and increase hit-points by one per level past one (or vice versa). Each of these options would strike a somewhat different balance between the more lingering wounds represented by hit-points versus the battle-fatigue and limited narrow evasions represented by stamina-points.
            <ul><li style="font-style:italic;">Another gritty option under this system would be for most magical healing to only affect hit-points and not stamina, while casting some other restorative spells (such as Lesser or Greater Restoration) could be modified to be able to allow players to instantenously spend any remaining hit-die to immediately regain stamina-points outside of rests or perhaps even to replenish hit-die faster than normal‽</li></ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="accordion_body">It requires no extensive justification, I hope, to state that there are both more as well as less “crunchy” rule-systems available in various tabletop-RPGs compared to D&D, and that “hit-points” have always been somewhat of an abstraction, with specific or crippling injuries being rare in D&D rules, characters generally fighting with maximal effectiveness right to the brink of unconsciousness and risking death, and thus “hit-points” often largely conceptualized as mounting-exhaustion from desperate parries or dodges wearing a character down a certain number of times before a fatal mistake finally leads to a potentially lethal hit actually fully landing. These house-rules would thus leave “Stamina-points” to fill that more traditional role (and remain more easily recovered between fights by rolling hit-dice [reflavored as “Stamina-dice”]), whereas “hit-points” could then instead serve a more realistically simulationist role to somewhat represent lingering injuries and physical impairments resulting from more desperate combats (as well as ensuring that magic which quickly heals wounds by restoring hit-points would not so easily restore one’s élan, morale, or “endurance” through sustained combat — as represented by “Stamina-points” — or vice versa...). This system also arguably allows for more realistic “rest and recovery” as well as “natural healing” mechanics by separating these more distinctly, while still allowing traditional magical means of more rapid healing in dire circumstances to occur in a more limited capacity.</p>

        <p class="accordion_body">In most circumstances, unless the DM wants to make a specific contextual exception for some reason or contextually rules that the skill-use in question doesn’t require exceptionally intricate talents or coordination to effectively collaborate on, in order to give someone “help” with a Skill-check by using the “Help” action, the “helper” must almost always be “proficient” with the relevant skill that the creature receiving help is using, otherwise the “helper” would just be more likely to get in the way, impede the use of the skill by the character primarily performing the action, lack some prerequisite training or lore necessary to contribute any meaningful assistance to a highly technical or obscure challenge, or otherwise cause problematic or distracting complications that would somehow interfere with the skill-use.

        <ul class="accordion_body">
          <li><span style="color:#e40712;">Ignore 5eDMG page 136 — “Alternatively, a character can focus on one magic item during a short rest, while being in physical contact with the item. At the end of the rest, the character learns the item’s properties, as well as how to use them. Potions are an exception; a little taste is enough to tell the taster what the potion does.” 🤬</span>
            <ul>
              <li>Instead more strictly, experimentally, and mysteriously prefer rules along the lines of the following in the DMG:</li>
              <li style="color:#2980b9;font-style:italic;">&laquo;Wearing or experimenting with an item can also offer hints about its properties. For example, if a character puts on a ring of jumping, you could say, “Your steps feel strangely springy.” Perhaps the character then jumps up and down to see what happens. You then say the character jumps unexpectedly high... Sometimes a magic item carries a clue to its properties. The command word to activate a ring might be etched in tiny letters inside it, or a feathered design might suggest that it’s a ring of feather falling.&raquo;</li>
              <li>An Intelligence (Arcana) check measures your ability to recall lore about spells, magic items, eldritch symbols, magical traditions, the planes of existence, and the inhabitants of those planes. This check requires special training or lore and thus normally has disadvantage (or may be impossible in some cases) unless proficient... However, if proficient, time spent studying the item (given resources to conduct sufficient research such as a library) or simply observationally experimenting with it could grant advantage on this check.</li>
              <li>Moreover, similar rules should apply to identifying poisons or potions: requiring a successful Wisdom (Medicine) check, or alternatively a Wisdom-check with proficiency if using and proficient with an appropriate “kit” depending on the harmful or helpful nature of the substance in question (i.e. poisoner’s or herbalism or alchemist’s).</li>
              <li>Also, per 5eDMG page 138 — Most methods of identifying items, including the “Identify” spell, will fail to reveal a curse, although lore might hint at it. A curse should be a surprise to the item’s user when the curse’s effects are revealed. Attunement to a cursed item can’t be ended voluntarily unless the curse is broken first, such as with the “remove curse” spell.</li>

If it is a magic item or some other magic-imbued object, your roll (versus the DC of whatever magic/enchantments may be involved) will determine how much you may or may not learn of its magic properties, how to use them, whether it requires attunement to use, any command words or gestures, and how many charges it has (if any), whether any spells are affecting the item and what they are, which spell created or could “recharge” the item (if any), etc. If you instead touch a creature throughout the casting, you learn what spells, if any, are currently affecting it, assuming these are not mysterious enchantment or illusion magics with a higher DC than your roll (in which case you should still at least detect what school of magic is in effect).</li>

        <p class="accordion_body">If you have a positive Intelligence-modifier of at least +2, you can take ½ of your Intelligence-modifier (rounded-down) of extra Languages that you can speak, read, and write — or tool-proficiencies (i.e. up to two extra languages or tools with the maximum 20 Intelligence-score and a +5 Intelligence-modifier). This house-rule is an attempt to somewhat better balance Intelligence against the more commonly useful benefits of other primary Ability Scores such as Dexterity or Wisdom or Charisma.<br><br>Consider allowing Warlocks with Intelligence as their casting stat in cases where the DM and player agree this can be appropriately flavored with the Warlock’s Patron of choice. If this house-rule is allowed, the class description and functionalities should work as written with any Warlock related mention of Charisma in class mechanics substituting Intelligence and Intelligence modifier instead.</p>

        <p class="accordion_body">A character can drink a potion as a bonus-action <span style="text-decoration:underline;">or</span> as an action, however, it still requires an action to feed a potion to another creature — and, in either case, requires at least one free hand in addition to consuming the one free “interact with object” action typically available per turn <small>(PHB page 190)</small>, which is required to draw the potion forth from where it was accessibly carried and get it ready to drink or feed to someone (with a couple fingers of a second hand or one’s teeth or thumb assumed to be sufficient to unstopper a potion in most cases). Also remember: for the purposes of gaining a free-hand if necessary to use the one free “interaction with object” per turn plus either an action or bonus-action for potion use, dropping anything that a character may be holding in one or both hands in order to free one up is a “free” action, and most “two-handed” weapons can arguably be temporarily held in one hand while not in use for active wielding which requires both hands.</p>
        <p class="accordion_body">However, in order to add a bit more dramatic risk to this common house-rule (which both speeds up combat and enhances everyone’s fun by preventing players from having to so often “waste” entire turns drinking potions), it could be ruled that drinking a potion as a bonus-action or feeding one to someone as an action, in addition to any other similar object interaction that the DM deems may put a character momentarily “off-guard” during combat (such as loading a weapon with that property, interacting with any relatively complex mechanism beyond operating a mere single switch/lever, handle, or knob, etc.), might provoke a reaction “attack-of-opportunity” from any adjacent hostile creatures within mêlée-attack-range and/or grant advantage on attacks against that character until their next turn, at the DM’s discretion!</p>

        <p class="accordion_body">Warlocks should arguably automatically get all the “Patron Spells” listed for their selected Patron as spells known when they reach the indicated Warlock levels, and this house-rule would further specify that these “Patron spells” do not compete with or count against the normal numbers of Warlock “spells known” that must be selected from the Warlock list. Thus, they don’t have to choose between either Patron Spells or learning more typical／generic Warlock spells, they just get their “Patron spells” at each designated level (similarly to Paladin or Cleric Oath／Domain spells). Warlocks have few enough spells they can cast in a day that this is arguably harmless enough to game balance unless your games tend to have far more short rests and daily combats than usual. Anyway, Warlocks would become arguably become significantly more fun and versatile spellcasters with this house-rule, plus it ensures that PCs can connect a lot more easily with the flavor of their “patron” when granted this boon to augment their magical options.</p>
