<div class="page">
  <h1 class="page-title">{{page.title}}</h1>
  <p>This page serves as a short philosophical treatise briefly summarizing B.F. Griffith’s methodological approach and goals in building “optimized” (but hopefully thematically interesting and distinctive) tabletop-RPG player-characters, primarily for 5th Edition D&D.</p>
  <p>Some of the builds published on these pages will be for much-loved characters he has personally playtested in various campaigns, while others are merely theorycrafted in the hope that he may one day have the opportunity to experience them in action — whether roleplayed by himself or someone else.</p>
  <p>All could, of course, also optionally be used as élite NPCs or adversaries with as much mechanical simplification (or further customization) as desired compared to rigorously following a fully detailed “by the book” player-character progression of advancement.</p>
  <p>Unless otherwise noted, most aspects of these builds will be strictly RAW (“rules as written”) — as well as hopefully also RAI (“rules as intended”) per all official errata and “Sage Advice” clarifications. However, these builds will take no interest whatsoever in conforming to Adventurer’s League limitations (such as “PHB+1” sourcebooks).</p>
  <p>On rare occasions, some builds may include “Unearthed Arcana” playtesting content — however, in that case, B.F. Griffith will attempt to clearly make note of that and subsequently update each build to reflect or leverage “officially published” rules and the most current “finalized” class or subclasses mechanics once those are available.</p>
  <p>Any homebrew or house-rules options or suggested DM rulings vis-à-vis RAI interpretations that might impact the build should also be distinctly noted as such and separated from what will otherwise hopefully be a scrupulously RAW-legal optimized build-progression summary in the overwhelming majority of cases.</p>
