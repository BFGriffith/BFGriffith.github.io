  <p class="accordion_body" style="color:#e40712;">Since Beastmaster would be more fun if it were stronger, mechanically (as compared to other classes’ somewhat scaling summoning options or wildshapes, for example) while not too overpowered, or simply if it didn’t have such illogical rules — and I didn’t think the UA version was a very good attempt at an adequate fix for many issues I have with such a poorly designed subclass — the following are some house-rules I've used to “fix” Beastmaster in case anyone is interested or playing in a not totally RAW game wherein a DM might be open to something like this. In my humble opinion (as a DM more often than a player, myself), I think the mechanics below are relatively well balanced and make the animal-companion fun enough to be worthwhile compared to other Ranger subclasses while not adding too much cumbersome complexity… (as well as providing more incentive to choose Ranger:Beastmaster over other classes...) *I may update parts of this in the future to default to the revision attempted in Tasha’s Cauldron of Everything instead of the PHB Beastmaster...</p>
  <ul class="accordion_body">
    <li><strong>Beastmaster Ranger’s Companion:</strong> at 3rd level, the Beastmaster gains a beast companion that accompanies the Ranger on his or her adventures and is trained to fight alongside the Beastmaster. Choose a beast no larger than Medium size and that has a challenge rating of ¼ or lower. Add the Ranger’s proficiency bonus to the beast’s AC, attack-rolls, damage-rolls, any saving-throws the Ranger is proficient with, and any skills the beast is proficient in. Its hit-point maximum equals the hit-point number in its stat-block plus four-times the Ranger’s class-level in temporary-HP (which it regains after completing a long rest, or can restore by expending its hit-dice during a short-rest, but which cannot be healed by other means or combined with any other source of temporary-hit-points). Like any creature, it can spend Hit-Dice during a short-rest to regain hit-points (and/or regain its temporary-hit-points up to a maximum of four-times the Ranger’s class-level). It has the number of hit-dice listed in its stat block. Beast companions attack once per round, and cannot perform the multi-attack action, even if it’s listed in their stat-block (exception: see Bestial Fury, below).</li>
    <li>The Animal Companion takes its turn on the Beastmaster’s initiative, and will automatically defend itself or its Ranger against any obviously hostile mêlée attackers each round unless commanded otherwise or unable due to some condition imposed on it. It will continue fighting perceivable and accessible attacker(s) until neither the Beastmaster nor it remains engaged by attackers, it becomes incapacitated, or the Beastmaster commands it otherwise using the Command Beast feature. However, while it could intimidatingly menace or threaten if circumstances warrant or commanded to do so, it will not usually initiate combat by attacking an opponent first without command unless that opponent attacks the Beastmaster or there is some other severe provocation. At the DM’s discretion, the beast might also automatically move to attack hostile ranged-attackers it can perceive if no closer hostile mêlée threat is present and the ranged threat is accessible and not too far away or separated by terrain too daunting to the beast’s movement capabilities (i.e. generally within short-range of most longer-range weapons unless the Beastmaster explicitly commands the beast to Dash forward and eventually attack more distant targets using the Command Beast feature).</li>
    <li>If the Beastmaster is incapacitated or absent, the beast acts on its own, focusing on protecting its companion Ranger and itself. The beast never requires any Ranger command to use its reaction, such as when making an opportunity-attack against an already hostile creature. The extent to which the beast may also form some lesser bond with (and be willing to automatically defend) any other allied PCs who are close companions of the Beastmaster as a secondary objective is up to player and DM discretion — but should not happen instantaneously or automatically without some experience adventuring together, and should never eclipse loyalty to the Ranger unless by the Ranger’s explicit command (and perhaps also a successful Wisdom: Animal-Handling check).</li>
    <li>While traveling through the Ranger’s favored terrain with only the beast, the Beastmaster and beast can move stealthily at a normal pace.</li>
    <li><strong>Command Beast:</strong> Beastmaster Rangers have the ability to issue simple and commonly practiced commands quickly to a trained beast companion (no action required by the Ranger beyond being able to use a “free-action” for short phrases and/or gestures as usual). Once per turn at any point during his or her turn, the Beastmaster can use his or her “free-action” to command the companion beast to attack (the closest clearly aggressive threat, if any) or to come to heel (the beast will Disengage if necessary and attempt to move and stay directly behind the Ranger until commanded otherwise, taking the Dodge action as soon as possible on each turn while in this mode unless needing to take the Dash action to keep pace following on the Ranger’s heels), or to flee/retreat/take-cover/hide (the beast will Disengage if necessary and flee or Dash evasively away from threats as best it can perceive during each of its turns, and will take cover well behind the Beastmaster and/or away from any threats if possible, finding the best cover it can and then attempting to Hide if possible, as the DM’s discretion dictates — but the beast will be reluctant to entirely flee the field beyond the range of the Beastmaster’s commands in any way that would completely abandon the Ranger).
      <ul>
        <li>Alternatively, the Beastmaster can use his or her own action to command the beast to perform more complex actions using verbal signals and/or gestures: such as to move to a specific location and/or take the Dash, Disengage, Dodge, or Help action — or to interact with an object in any way within the companion creature’s physical capabilities, including to fetch an item it can carry and attempt to return it to the Beastmaster (this may also require a successful Wisdom: Animal-Handling check). The Beastmaster can also use his or her action to command the beast to defend a specific ally instead of the Beastmaster or to attack a specific creature (rather than the nearest clear threat or opponent threatening the Beastmaster) — or to scout a perceivable general area (with a successful Wisdom: Animal-Handling check), etc.</li>
        <li>Once engaged in combat, a Beastmaster’s companion beast will typically continue attacking a creature until that creature is defeated, the beast is incapacitated, the Beastmaster issues a different command, or a condition is imposed on the beast that changes its behavior.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Raise Beast Companion:</strong> when the Beastmaster’s companion beast reaches zero hit-points, it makes death saving throws like a player-character or important NPC. If the beast dies, the Ranger can expend three spell-slots (of any level) to perform a Raise Beast Companion ritual on its corpse (if recoverable and mostly intact). The ritual takes one hour and can be performed during a short-rest (though doing so would deny the Ranger any benefit of that rest); if completed, the ritual raises the animal companion from the dead with one hit-point. Alternatively, the Beastmaster can obtain a new companion by spending eight hours finding (assuming availability of a suitable companion animal in local terrain), magically bonding with, and training a beast that isn’t hostile to the Ranger and that meets the requirements and limitations in these rules (in case a Beastmaster’s companion is lost, released/dismissed to the wild in preparation to focus on training another type of companion-animal, or killed).</li>
    <li><strong>Exceptional Training:</strong> beginning at 7th level of the Ranger: Beastmaster class, the Ranger can use a bonus-action (instead of an action) to issue advanced commands to the beast companion.</li>
    <li><strong>Bestial Fury:</strong> starting at 11th level of the Ranger: Beastmaster class, the beast companion can take the Multiattack action if it has that action. In addition, the beast companion’s attacks are considered “magical” for the purpose of overcoming resistance to physical damage that is not magical.</li>
    <li><strong>Share Spells:</strong> beginning at 15th level of the Ranger: Beastmaster class, when the Ranger casts a spell targeting himself and the beast companion is within 30feet of the Beastmaster, the Ranger can choose for the spell to also affect the beast. Also, the Beastmaster can now obtain a beast companion that is a beast type creature of CR½ or lower. Additionally, if the Ranger expends one second-level spell-slot to cast the Beast Sense spell/ritual (PHBpage217) on the beast companion, the Beastmaster can perceive through the senses of the beast companion as usual with that spell but can also control the beast, make use of any of its special attacks and qualities, and undertake any action the animal can physically accomplish (even if the animal would normally lack the intelligence to perform the action in question despite advance training) — though the beast may get a Wisdom saving-throw if extreme or unnatural or suicidal actions are commanded; while concentrating on this spell, the Ranger PC has the blinded condition and can only see and hear what the beast can, but can blindly take the move action or otherwise blindly act normally on his turn as long as Concentration and control is maintained controlling the beast’s actions during the same turn through its perception.</li>
    <li><strong>Beastlord:</strong> beginning at 17th level of the Ranger: Beastmaster class, the Beastmaster can obtain a beast companion that is a beast type creature of CR1 or lower or that is Large size or smaller.</li>
    <li><span style="color:green;font-style:bold;">optional Command-Beast-mechanic with DM approval (which could be granted right at 3rd level and potentially upgraded or replaced by a magical version of this item at higher-levels):</span> a command-whistle could work in parallel or alternative to any verbal or silent-gesture commands that a bonded companion can receive from the Ranger whose authority it respects (using the same rules as Beastmaster free/basic-mode or advanced “Command-Beast” options above as appropriate), with the range probably limited to how far the creature can hear (requiring a Perception-check at the DM’s discretion if on the edge of maximum range where the companion might not hear the whistle): but potentially farther than line-of-sight or even farther than shouted verbal commands (with DM approval or with more powerful magic-item versions of this whistle); regardless, the whistle should have a clasp allowing it to be attached to a necklace or chain so that it can be worn around a character’s neck and used hands-free by being placed at the ready between a character’s lips using the one free object interaction per turn (as long as a character has at least a couple fingers free to place the whistle between his/her lips even while holding most items or could make a Dexterity-check to maneuver the whistle into his/her mouth if wearing its necklace with no hands available including while bound/restrained). Such whistles normally make sounds at frequencies most humanoids cannot hear (though creatures with superior auditory senses such as animal-companions can either hear it automatically or perhaps make a Perception-check to try to hear it at the DM’s discretion). </li>
