    >This page serves as a table of contents to access many of B.F. Griffith’s powerfully “optimized” (as well as hopefully thematically interesting and distinctive) personal favorite 5eD&D character-builds. Some are builds he has personally playtested, while others are merely theorycrafted in the hope that he may one day have the opportunity to experience them in action.
