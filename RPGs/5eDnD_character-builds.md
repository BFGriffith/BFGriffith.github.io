    >This page serves as a table of contents to access many of B.F. Griffith’s relatively powerfully “optimized” (as well as hopefully thematically interesting and distinctive) personal favorite 5ₑ D＆D character-builds.<br>Some are builds he has personally playtested, while others are merely theorycrafted in the hope that he may one day have the opportunity to experience them in action.<br>All could, of course, also optionally be used as élite NPCs or adversaries with as much mechanical simplification (or further customization) as desired compared to rigorously following a fully detailed “by the book” player-character progression of advancement (which traditionally isn’t deemed necessary for most monsters or NPCs).
