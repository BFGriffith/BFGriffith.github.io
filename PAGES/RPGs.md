  >This page is a freely available compendium of many of B.F. Griffith’s short writings pertaining to his much enjoyed hobby of collaboratively imaginative tabletop roleplaying games, especially Dungeons & Dragons (and primarily 5th Edition D&D, these days) — in particular, this page compiles and links to some of B.F. Griffith’s preferred 5eD&D house-rules, customized homebrews, and powerfully “optimized” (as well as hopefully thematically interesting) character-builds.
