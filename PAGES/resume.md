### <a name="professional-experience"></a>PROFESSIONAL-EXPERIENCES:

#### full-stack Web-Developer:

* Solutions Specialist working on a variety of enterprise Federal consulting projects (February 6, 2017 through present) involving multifarious frameworks, libraries, tech-stacks

#### Substitute-Teacher:

* Kelly Services — _Orange County Public Schools_
  * November, 2012 through February 2013 and October 9, 2013 through September 2014
  * Despite switching careers quite drastically midlife to become a web-developer instead of continuing teaching, Mr. Griffith is proud of his service over several years as a subsitute teacher (no matter how overqualified) in various schools around Orange County at a point when he was learning to code and doing freelance web-development work but also still considering continuing his first career as an educator.

### Social-Studies Teacher:

* grades 9-12 (August, 2005 through June, 2012)
* _New Dimensions High School_ — 4900 Old Pleasant Hill Road, Kissimmee, FL 34759
  *	Taught ninth through twelfth graders such classes as Advanced Placement world history, world history, American history, global studies / geography, American government, and economics (including honors level versions of nearly all of those classes). 
  *	As a member of Florida’s 2009 first-place High School Literacy Leadership Team of the year: fostered excellence in literacy education and contributed to the continuous improvement of students’ reading-comprehension and writing skills, encouraged enthusiasm for unassigned reading as well as abiding lifelong enjoyment of books, conducted and participated in faculty professional development sessions focused on teaching reading, and enhanced the overall literary rigor of the academic environment. 
  *	Well trained in curricular and lesson design and research-based teaching techniques at the graduate level (and subsequently enhanced by multifarious inservice workshops over seven years of professionally teaching high school social studies). Skilled at differentiating and individuating instruction as well as effectively scaffolding lessons to keep students of all levels optimally challenged, encouraged, supported, and rapidly progressing in their zones of proximal development.
  *	Volunteer faculty coach / facilitator for seven years of the school’s Chess club and Fine-Arts club (teaching interested students basic drawing and painting in addition to more advanced techniques of perspective, proportion, composition, blending, and shading). Solid fine-arts and visual-design liberal-arts educational background.

#### Assistant-Director: _Camp Orca_ — American Red Cross (Green Mountain Chapter: Shaftsbury, Vermont)

* June, 2004 though August, 2004
* supervised three counselors and was responsible for the curriculum, instruction, and safety of summer day-campers (ages six through thirteen)


#### video-store Clerk at _Movie Gallery_

* Summer, 2003
* jockeyed a register in the video store and kept the shelves stocked and the inventory updated; this was the definition of “unskilled” entry-level minimum-wage drudery — but it did make me feel like I was a character in a Kevin Smith movie...

#### baker at _Interstate Brands Corporation_

* Summer, 2002
* worked a variety of jobs on the “Wonder bread” buns, breads, and croutons assembly lines; mind-numbingly boring does not even begin to describe the experience of serving as a literal cog in the machine...

#### irrigation-systems installer and technician at _McClurg & Creamer_

* Summers of 2000 and 2001
* progressed from general labor, landscaping, and lawn care to a working knowledge of all fundamental aspects of irrigation-system installation and maintenance

#### stock-clerk and salesperson at _Meijer, Inc._

* Summer, 1999
* had sole responsibility for restocking and counter-sales in the gifts, lamps, small appliances, and jewelry departments on the graveyard shift — at least it was a step up from Walmart despite being open 24 hours, but there were still plenty of sketchy characters to deal with throughout many a night in some of the departments I was responsible for, so at times the job was certainly full of surprises...

#### sailing instructor at _North Cape Yacht Club_

* Summers of 1996 through 1998
* responsible for day-camp counseling and instruction of junior sailing students (ages six through fourteen), as well as equipment maintenance & safety; Tthis was by far the most fun job of my youth!
