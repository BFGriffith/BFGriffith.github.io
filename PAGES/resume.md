<h1>📜 +1 “Relentless Revenant Résumé of Remunerating Recompense” 💵</h1><small>(Legendary Cursed Item, requires Attunement, Lawful Evil Alignment)</small>

<p><small>B.F. Griffith is an experienced and perpetually busy full-stack web-developer﹠software-engineer with substantial experience with enterprise scale applications but extremely limited availability for taking on any additional open-source collaborations or freelance side-projects, of which he consistently has several of his own underway… in addition, of course, to his plenty demanding﹠complex full-time day job always hungry for more productivity.<br><br>Consequently, if you’re hoping to engage his skills professionally for freelance consultations or substantially contributive design or coding collaborations on a project, it’d have to be an unusually enticing pitch for something that he personally happens to find very idiosyncratically interesting, too lucratively compensated to pass up, or both… Otherwise, he would most likely prefer to kindly point you toward <a href="https://orlandodevs.com/slack/" target="_blank">other reliable tech community resources full of plenty of burgeoning developers</a> who might be a better fit for more mundane or routine technical﹠programming needs (such as building you or your business a blog, portfolio website, or eCommerce platform). For anyone interested in learning to code, however, he’s certainly happy to chat about his experiences in the tech industry over some coffee or tea sometime to offer whatever advice or mentorship he can!</small></p>

<h3><a name="professional-experience"></a>PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCES＆Curriculum Vitæ 📋</h3>

#### full-stack Web-Developer:

* Solutions Specialist at Deloitte working on a wide variety of [enterprise scale Federal consulting projects](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/pages/careers/articles/join-deloitte-us-delivery-centers.html) (February 6, 2017 through present) with tech-stacks involving a plethora of frameworks, libraries, APIs, microservices, complex networking or cybersecurity or DevOps deployments requirements, and other Systems Administration tasks serving diverse U.S. government clients, with most of those projects requiring his active [Top Secret Security Clearance](https://handbook.tts.gsa.gov/general-information-and-resources/business-and-ops-policies/top-secret/)

#### Substitute-Teacher:

* Kelly Services — _Orange County Public Schools_
  * November, 2012 through February 2013 and October 9, 2013 through September 2014
  * Despite switching careers quite drastically midlife to become a web-developer, Mr. Griffith is proud of his service over several years as a substitute teacher (no matter how overqualified) in various schools around Orange County at a point when he was still autodidactically learning to code while doing freelance web-development work, but also still considering perhaps continuing with his first career as an educator in some capacity that could better leverage his technical skills. At the time, this job was a flexible option to supplement his income while building up proven professional experience as a coder before he was recruited by Deloitte.

### Social-Studies Teacher:

* grades 9⤑12 (August, 2005 through June, 2012)
* _New Dimensions High School_ — 4900 Old Pleasant Hill Road, Kissimmee, Florida 34759
  *	Taught ninth through twelfth graders such classes as Advanced Placement world history, world history, American history, global studies／geography, American government, and economics (including honors level versions of nearly all of those classes). 
  *	As a member of Florida’s 2009 first-place High School Literacy Leadership Team of the year: fostered excellence in literacy education which contributed to the continuous improvement of students’ reading-comprehension and writing skills, encouraged enthusiasm for unassigned reading as well as abiding lifelong enjoyment of books, conducted and participated in faculty professional development sessions focused on teaching reading, and enhanced the overall literary rigor of the academic environment.
  *	Well trained in curricular and lesson design of research-based teaching techniques at the graduate level (and subsequently enhanced by multifarious inservice workshops over seven years of professionally teaching high school social studies); skilled at differentiating and individuating instruction as well as effectively scaffolding lessons to keep students of all proficiency levels optimally challenged, encouraged, supported, and rapidly progressing in their zones of proximal development.
  *	Volunteer faculty coach＆facilitator for seven years of the school’s Chess club and Fine-Arts club (teaching interested students basic drawing＆painting in addition to more advanced techniques of perspective, proportion, composition, blending, and shading). These experiences augmented Mr. Griffith’s already rigorous fine-arts＆visual-design liberal-arts＆humanities educational background, ultimately adding unusual depth as well as creative spatial＆aesthetic reasoning approaches to many of his web-development UI/UX design implementations or layout＆styling capabilities.

#### Assistant-Director: _Camp Orca_ — American Red Cross (Green Mountain Chapter: Shaftsbury, Vermont)

* June, 2004 though August, 2004
* supervised three counselors and was responsible for the curriculum, instruction, and safety of summer day-campers (ages six through thirteen) 🥾


#### video-store Clerk at _Movie Gallery_

* Summer, 2003
* jockeyed a register in a local video store, kept its shelves stocked, and kept its inventory updated; this job was the definition of “unskilled” entry-level minimum-wage drudgery, but it did at least sometimes feel like playing a character in a Kevin Smith movie… 📼

#### baker at _Interstate Brands Corporation_

* Summer, 2002
* B.F. Griffith worked a variety of jobs on the “Wonder bread” brand buns, breads, and croutons assembly lines; mind-numbingly boring doesn’t even begin to describe the experience of serving as a literal “cog in the machine” by doing relentlessly repetitive physical labor functions that were ripe for being automated out of existence whenever management could muster the capital for upgrading their factory to more advanced and streamlined baking machinery. It’s doubtful anyone who worked there could forget the giant quantities of industrial scale preservatives dumped from five gallon buckets into most supermarket “bread” aisle baked goods to enable the “Wonder” of such unnaturally long shelf-lives; indeed, those experiences can tend to motivate more expensive tastes ever since for preferring significantly fresher, more artisanal, and admittedly much more perishable baked goods whenever they’re available. Machines kneading huge balls of dough the size of cars are emblems of modernity quite impressive to behold though… and could fit right into the <a href="https://www.spiritofbaraka.com/ron-fricke" target="_blank" rel="noopener">awesome time-lapse cinematography</a> of <a href="https://www.barakasamsara.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a Ron Frike film</a>, although even the mesmerizingly entrancing minimalism of a Phillip Glass style musical score could not have made overtime shifts at that baking factory seem to end any faster. This was certainly the sort of job that underscores the value of labor unions and collective bargaining! 🍞

#### irrigation-systems installer and technician at _McClurg & Creamer_

* Summers of 2000 and 2001
* B.F. Griffith progressed from general labor, landscaping, and lawn care to a broad working knowledge of all fundamental aspects of irrigation-systems installation and maintenance of both residential and commercial sprinklers. While far from the most “enjoyable” trade or handicraft he has ever learned, it was definitely the sort of occupation that could deservedly be featured on Mike Rowe’s “Dirty Jobs” documentary series; doing that work over several summers was great exercise in the strong prime of youth, and it certainly also taught some harsh lessons about what the value and dignity of hard work ought to be for wage earners routinely performing “hard labor” tasks in a more just and respectful society than the dehumanizing and exploitative one we unfortunately still perpetuate.🚿

#### stock-clerk and salesperson at _Meijer, Inc._

* Summer, 1999
* B.F. Griffith had sole responsibility for restocking and counter-sales in the gifts, lamps, small appliances, and jewelry departments on the graveyard shift; at least it was a step up from Walmart working conditions despite also being open 24 hours, but there were still plenty of sketchy characters to deal with or try to keep an eye on while juggling the primary responsibilities of constantly stocking shelves throughout many a weary night singlehandedly “tending” so many departments, but at least the job was occasionally full of some entertaining surprises for the equally understaffed night shift store security and “loss prevention” team to deal with… Suffice it to say that “the customer” is definitely <u>not</u> always right! (and indignant demands to speak with a manager usually only underscore that, especially when it comes to grifters) 🏪

#### sailing instructor at _North Cape Yacht Club_

* Summers of 1996 through 1998
* B.F. Griffith was responsible for day-camp counseling, instruction, and dinghy racing regatta training of junior sailing students (ages six through fourteen), as well as general equipment maintenance and safety; this was an extraordinarily fun job that unequivocally made him the capable, competent, responsible, and experienced sailor that he is to this day! ⛵
