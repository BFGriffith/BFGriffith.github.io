# links to other assorted fun practice／demo Applications:
* Many of the projects linked below represent B.F. Griffith’s earlier progress initially learning to code prior to 2017…
* Since then, the overwhelming majority of his much more advanced professional work for (mostly Federal) clients has unfortunately been closed-source, though he is endeavoring to make more progress on [several substantial open-source personal side projects also linked on this page](#planned_pending) in the coming years…
> 💥 **NOTE:** Many of the following applications still have their source code visible on GitHub but are currently no longer hosted since **Heroku** ended their free tier of cloud based deployment platforms in November of 2022; unfortunately, many of these small demo projects had been conveniently deployed there, but BFGriffith has not yet managed to find＆implement a suitable alternative free replacement hosting for most of these❗🏗
