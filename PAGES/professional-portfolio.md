Welcome to the [web-development＆software-engineering]({{base}}/resume/) [**open-source** personal or hobby projects](https://github.com/BFGriffith?tab=repositories) portfolio of B.F. Griffith: a skilled full-stack developer, Systems Administrator, and front-end UI/UX expert with nearly a decade of coding experience designing﹠planning as well as functionally writing, deploying, and maintaining responsive, efficient, and user-friendly enterprise scale applications using a variety of frameworks﹠libraries. Many of the projects featured below represent his earlier progress learning to code prior to 2017. Since then, the overwhelming majority of his most advanced work for (mostly Federal) clients has unfortunately been closed-source, though he is endeavoring to make more progress on some of the following ongoing open-source personal side projects in the coming years…

# links to personal project Applications:
> 💥 **NOTE:** Many of the following applications still have their code visible on GitHub but are currently no longer hosted since **Heroku** ended their free tier of cloud based deployment platforms in November of 2022; unfortunately, many of these small demo projects had been conveniently deployed there, but BFGriffith has not yet managed to find＆implement a suitable alternate free replacement for most of these❗🏗
