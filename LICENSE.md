Copyright © ⇢ B.F. Griffith (@BFGriffith)

For the purposes of this copyright and license, “author(s)” shall be defined as the following set of individuals:
* Benjamin Forbes Griffith
* anyone else who may author (whether in whole or in part) at least one “guest” or collaborative page or post (or who provides significant original open source code contributions to this repository) which B.F. Griffith (at his sole discretion) approves for merging onto the master branch of this repository (and thus agrees to publish indefinitely and deploys to any part of the BFGriffith.github.io GitHub Pages website)

This repository’s functional and stylistic open source Jekyll, HTML markup, and customized CSS code is provided “as-is” — without any express or implied warranty or guarantee of fitness for any purpose. In no event will its author(s) be held liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, exemplary, or consequential damages which may arise from the use of this repository or its source-code, regardless of whether or not anyone is advised of the possibility of any such damage(s) whatsoever.

Permission is hereby granted to anyone to use, copy, modify, and distribute any functional or stylistic (rather than substantive content) portions of this repository’s source-code for any non-commercial／nonprofit applications or purposes whatsoever, and to alter it and redistribute it freely, without fee, subject to the following restrictions:

1. The authorship of any original (non dependency library subject to its own terms) unique or distinctive portions this repository’s source-code must not be misrepresented; no person or persons other than the author(s) may falsely claim that they wrote any customized or bespoke portions of this repository’s code without citing proper attribution. If anyone other than the author(s) do clone and repurpose any significant portions of this repository’s code for any non-commercial use, a written acknowledgement or citation somewhere in that application’s documentation would be appreciated as a gracious gesture of artisanal etiquette.
2. Altered source customized versions or repurposed “forks” of this repository’s source-code must be plainly marked as such — and must not, under any circumstances, ever be misrepresented as if they were “original” copies or pristine clones of this repository.
3. Any significant or substantively unique original or customized portions of this repository and its software (beyond its baseline “Poole+Hyde” Jekyll templates) may not ever be used for any commercial or for-profit use(s) or sold as part of any product or service without express written permission from the author(s). This especially includes the substantively displayed textual contents of ANY Markdown.md files in the repository.
4. This notice may not be removed from or altered within any source distribution or offline backup of portions of this site (beyond its baseline “Poole+Hyde” Jekyll templates subject to their own terms) without express written permission from the author(s).
5. The separate MIT licence (also included at the root of this repository) applies to — and less restrictively governs — Mark Otto’s “Poole＋Hyde” Jekyll templates upon which this static GitHub Pages site is based; please respect the terms of that license if you also want to construct a similar GitHub Pages site (or any for-profit Jekyll website) using that less elaborate but excellent and well-documented baseline scaffolding template as a legally permissable starting-point.
6. Under the authority of Article I, Section 8, Clause 8 of the United States Constitution, the right of the author(s) of any substantive (non-code) documents and written content of this portfolio site, blog, and static pages to be identified as having authored that Work has been asserted whenever it is published into this repository, in accordance with the federal Copyright Act.© These substantive or semantic (rather than functional or stylistic) written contents are not legally transferable without consent; all ownership rights thereto are reserved by the author(s). Ergo, no substantive visible written content portions of these publications may be used or reproduced in any unauthorized manner without prior written permission from the author(s) — except in case of brief quotations embodied in critical reviews, scholarly citations, portions already designated as reference documents freely available in the creative commons, and certain other noncommercial uses permitted by copyright law. Any plagiarized reproduction or unauthorized distribution of copyrighted (non-code) written work published on this website is illegal; no substantive part of the displayed written contents of this website that constitute original works may be scanned, uploaded, transmitted, or stored in a retrieval system outside of this repository (via the Internet or any other means: electronic, mechanical, photocopying, recording, or print) without written permission from the author(s) for any permanently stored reproductions beyond the limited scope of private research for intended submissions of prospective contributions to this repository as a duly credited guest author or personal offline backup cloning of its contents onto your local devices to facilitate offline access.
7. However, forks or clones of this site are permitted and welcome, with any pull-request approvals and merging into its master branch immediately conferring the rights and privileges of “author” status detailed herein vis-à-vis the contents of any specific contributions, posts, pages, or other assets in question — but with B.F. Griffith perpetually maintaining the overall Copyright © for this repository and the substantive website contents it generates per the terms of this license.
