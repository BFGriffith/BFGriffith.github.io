Copyright © — B.F. Griffith (@BFGriffith)

For the purposes of this copyright and license, “author(s)” shall be defined as the following set of individuals:
* Benjamin Forbes Griffith
* anyone else with a page or post (or significant original code contributions) approved for merging onto the master branch of this repository (and thus published and deployed to the site)

This repository’s code is provided “as-is” — without any express or implied warranty or guarantee of fitness for any purpose. In no event will the author(s) be held liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, exemplary, or consequential damages which may arise from the use of this repository or its source-code, regardless of whether or not anyone is advised of the possibility of such damage(s).

Permission is hereby granted to anyone to use, copy, modify, and distribute this repository’s source-code, or functional and stylistic (rather than substantive content) portions thereof: for any non-commercial/nonprofit applications or purposes whatsoever, and to alter it and redistribute it freely, without fee, subject to the following restrictions:

1. The origin of this repository’s source-code must not be misrepresented; no person or persons other than the author(s) may falsely claim that they wrote any original portions of this code without citing proper attribution. If anyone other than the author(s) use significant portions of this code for any non-commercial use, an acknowledgement in the application’s documentation would be appreciated!
2. Altered source versions or “forks” of this repository’s source-code must be plainly marked as such, and must not be misrepresented as being original copies or pristine clones.
3. Significant original portions of this software (beyond its baseline “Poole+Hyde” Jekyll templates) may not be used for any commercial or for-profit use or sold as part of any product or service without express written permission from the author(s).
4. This notice may not be removed from or altered within any source distribution or offline backup of portions of this site (beyond its baseline “Poole+Hyde” Jekyll templates) without express written permission from the author(s).
5. The separate MIT licence (also included at the root of this repository) applies to — and less restrictively governs — Mark Otto’s “Poole+Hyde” Jekyll templates upon which this static GitHub Pages site is based; please respect that license if you also want to construct a similar GitHub Pages site (or any for-profit Jekyll site) using that less elaborate but excellent and well-documented baseline scaffolding template as a starting-point.
6. Under the authority of Article I, Section 8, Clause 8 of the United States Constitution, the right of the author(s) of any substantive (non-code) documents and written content of this portfolio site, blog, and static pages to be identified as having authored that Work has been asserted whenever it is published into this repository, in accordance with the federal Copyright Act.© These substantive or semantic (rather than functional or stylistic) written contents are not legally transferable without consent; all ownership rights thereto are reserved by the author(s). Ergo, no substantive visible written content portions of these publications may be used or reproduced in any unauthorized manner without prior written permission from the author(s) — except in case of brief quotations embodied in critical reviews, scholarly citations, portions already designated as reference documents freely available in the creative commons, and certain other noncommercial uses permitted by copyright law. Any plagiarized reproduction or unauthorized distribution of copyrighted (non-code) written work published on this website is illegal; no substantive part of the displayed written contents of this website that constitute original works may be scanned, uploaded, transmitted, or stored in a retrieval system outside of this repository (via the Internet or any other means: electronic, mechanical, photocopying, recording, or print) without written permission from the author(s) — or beyond the limited intention of contribution to this repository as an author or offline backup of its contents on your local device.
7. However, forks or clones of this site are permitted, with pull-requests approved and merging into its master branch immediately conferring the rights and privileges of “author” status detailed herein vis-à-vis the contents of any specific contributions, posts, pages, or oher assets in question — but with B.F. Griffith perpetually maintaining the overall Copyright© for this repository and the substantive website contents it generates per the terms of this license.
