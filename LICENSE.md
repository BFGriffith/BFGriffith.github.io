Copyright © ⇢ B.F. Griffith (@BFGriffith)

For the purposes of this copyright and license, “author(s)” shall be defined as the following set of individuals:
* Benjamin Forbes Griffith
* anyone else who may author (whether in whole or in part) at least one “guest” or collaborative page or post (or who provides significant original open source code contributions to this repository) which B.F. Griffith (at his sole discretion) approves for merging onto the master branch of this repository (and thus agrees to publish indefinitely＆deploys to any part of the BFGriffith.github.io GitHub Pages website)

This repository’s functional＆stylistic open source Jekyll, HTML markup, and customized CSS code is provided “as-is” — without any express or implied warranty or guarantee of fitness for any purpose. In no event will its author(s) be held liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, exemplary, or consequential damages which may arise from any use of this repository or its source-code, regardless of whether or not anyone is advised of the possibility of any such damage(s) whatsoever.

Permission is hereby granted to anyone to use, copy, modify, and distribute any functional or stylistic (rather than substantive content) portions of this repository’s source-code for any non-commercial／nonprofit applications or purposes whatsoever, as well as to alter it or redistribute it freely, without fee, subject to the following restrictions:

1. The authorship of any original (non dependency library subject to its own terms) unique or distinctive substantive written content (non-code) portions of this repository’s source-code must not be misrepresented; no person or persons other than the author(s) may falsely claim that they wrote any customized or bespoke portions of this repository’s written contents without citing proper attribution. If anyone other than the author(s) do clone＆repurpose any significant portions of this repository’s code for any non-commercial use, such as to use it as an exemplary “template” to construct a similar Jekyll GitHub pages site replacing its substantive content with their own, a written acknowledgement or citation somewhere in that application’s documentation would be appreciated as a gracious gesture of artisanal etiquette.
2. Altered source customized versions or repurposed “forks” of this repository’s source-code must be plainly marked as such — and they must not, under any circumstances, ever be misrepresented as if they were “original” copies or pristine clones of this repository.
3. Any significant or substantively unique original or customized portions of this repository and its software (beyond its baseline “Poole＋Hyde” Jekyll templates available under their own licenses) may not ever be used for any commercial or for-profit use(s) or sold as part of any product or service without express written permission from the author(s) of this repository. This especially includes the substantively displayed unique semantic wording of the textual contents of ANY “Markdown” .md files in the repository.
4. This notice may not be removed from or altered within any source distribution or offline backup of portions of this site (beyond its baseline “Poole＋Hyde” Jekyll templates subject to their own terms) without express written permission from the author(s).
5. The separate MIT licence (also included at the root of this repository) only narrowly applies to, and less restrictively governs, Mark Otto’s “Poole＋Hyde” Jekyll templates upon which many fundamental aspects of this static GitHub Pages site are based; please respect the terms of that license if you also want to construct a similar GitHub Pages site (or any for-profit Jekyll website) using those less elaborate but excellently well-documented baseline scaffolding templates as a legally permissable starting-point (links to them are available in their stylesheets).
6. Under the authority of Article I, Section 8, Clause 8 of the United States Constitution, the rights of the author(s) of any substantive (non-code) documents or written content of this portfolio site, personal journals, or static pages to be identified as having authored that Work have been asserted whenever the contents of these files are published into this public GitHub repository, in accordance with the federal Copyright Act.© These “substantive” or semantic written contents (rather than functional or stylistic “code”) are not legally transferable without consent; all ownership rights thereto are reserved by the author(s). Ergo, no substantive visible written content portions of these BFGriffith.GitHub.io publications may be used or reproduced in any unauthorized manner without prior written permission from the author(s) — except in case of brief quotations embodied in critical reviews, scholarly citations, portions already designated as reference documents freely available in the creative commons, or certain other limited noncommercial uses permitted by copyright law. Any plagiarized reproduction or unauthorized distribution of copyrighted (non-code) written work published on this website is illegal; no substantive part of the displayed written contents of this website that constitute original works may be scanned, uploaded, transmitted, or stored in a retrieval system outside of this repository (via the Internet or any other means: electronic, mechanical, photocopying, recording, print, etc.) without explicit written permission from the author(s) for any permanently stored reproductions beyond the limited scope of private research for intended submissions of prospective contributions to this repository as a duly credited guest author or personal offline backup cloning of its contents onto your local devices to facilitate offline access for strictly noncommercial purposes.
7. Nevertheless, forks or clones of this repository are permitted＆welcome, with any pull-request approval＋merging into its “master” branch immediately conferring the rights＆privileges of “author” status detailed herein vis-à-vis the particular contents of any specific unique substantive contributions, posts, pages, or other assets in question — but with B.F. Griffith perpetually＆irrevocably maintaining the overall Copyright © for this repository as well as the right to continuously publish on GitHub pages the substantive website contents it generates per the terms of this license, including any contributions by other authors submitted to this repository as pull-requests, approved, and merged.
